# XsvLib

> _This library is a copy of my CSV and TSV handling library
that you can find at https://github.com/ttelcl/LclXsv .
After exploring a few options to publish this library as NuGet
package and using that in the bike-app, I realized that the most
robust and quick way was to simply include this library in
source code form as another visual studio project in this
solution._


Library for reading and writing CSV and TSV and similar
files (collectively refered to as "XSV").

This library provides the core functionality without too
many fancy additions...

This library is a redesign of a similar library that I have
developed over the years. This reimplementation strives to
fix some of the issues in that earlier version.
